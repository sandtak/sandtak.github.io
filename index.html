							<h2>Our experience</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Ever seen a PAAS running over 300 production applications? Chances are, we built it. We've got the scars to prove it, we're battle hardened. Adopting Cloud Foundry since its infancy, the team behind sanktak ltd has over 4 years experience of doing this for a large FTSE 100 media organisation. Not limited to Cloud Foundry, we keep abreast of all new and emerging cloud technologies giving our clients the edge.</p>

							<h2>The USP</h2>
						</header>
						<p>We design for 5 nines, not just aspire to it. This is where sandtak comes into its own.</p>
						<p>Global businesses understand the need for IT geo-resilience in a 24x7x365 world. According to Gartner, the cost to organisations of planning and managing disaster recovery testing can reach $150,000.</p>
						<p>sandtak's take? Disaster recovery is a cloud anti-pattern and should be designed out of your implementation from the ground up especially in the case of a PAAS. Where high uptime is a requirement, we build all run time components to be active in 2 data centers such that your applications continue to run even in the event of a data center failure. This is a shift away from the uncertainties of maintaining a fully scaled yet passive 2nd data center. Further, by its very nature, PAAS clouds are a consistent deployment and runtime platform for all applications. Run 10 apps or 1000, the same dual data center features apply to them all.</p>

							<h2>sandtak Data Services</h2>

						<p>The rich set of plug-in data services developed at sandtak allow you to choose from almost any data store on the market from open source databases like Cassandra and MongoDB to traditional offerings such as Oracle. Data services are organised into 3 tiers and can run synchronously or asynchronously.</p>

							<h2>Microservices</h2>
						</header>
						<p>A powerful side effect of using a PAAS is the flexibility to break down applications into suites of independently deployable services. This reduces risk to your business as you no longer need to worry about big bang monolithic production deployments. It's a pattern that sandtAk endorse and provide training around in client engagements.</p>

							<h2>Cloud Strategy elevator pitch</h2>
						</header>
						<p>PAAS and IAAS cloud solutions reduce friction for your DevOps and software engineers and accelerate the path to production. How? The key is in self-service and auto provisioning cloud tools. From logging and monitoring to firewalls and load balancers - your developers are in control. No more waiting on external infrastructure and network teams. As an example, suppose you need a simple website to market a new product. Time to production in the traditional model? Perhaps 2 days development plus 4 weeks infrastructure provisioning. In the PAAS/IAAS cloud world, developers be in production as quickly as they can develop. In this case, 2 days! Mix in the microservices already mentioned and, voilà, you have the power of the cloud.</p>
